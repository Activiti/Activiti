/*
 * In Activiti 7  and Activiti Cloud we discourage the use of @Internal marked classes. These classes are
 * internal services and we recommend to use the new API interfaces located under "org.activiti.api"
 * Internal services might be deprecated or radically changed in further releases of Activiti 7 and beyond.
 * We recommend to get in touch via http://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/issues if you want to expand the capabilities of
 * the external/public APIs
