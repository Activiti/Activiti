/**
 * Represents a deployment that is already present in the process repository.
 *
 * A deployment is a container for resources such as process definitions, images, forms, etc.
 *
 * When a deployment is 'deployed' through the {@link org.activiti.engine.RuntimeService}, the Activiti engine will recognize certain of such resource types and act upon them (eg process definitions
 * will be parsed to an executable Java artifact).
 *
 * To create a Deployment, use the {@link org.activiti.engine.repository.DeploymentBuilder}. A Deployment on itself is a <b>read-only</b> object and its content cannot be changed after deployment
 * (hence the builder that needs to be used).
