 * Interface for class that acts as a scope for variables: i.e. the implementation
 * can be used to set and get variables.
 *
 * Typically, executions (and thus process instances) and tasks are the primary use case
 * to get and set variables. The {@link DelegateExecution} for example is often used
 * in {@link JavaDelegate} implementation to get and set variables.
 *
 * Variables are typically stored on the 'highest parent'. For executions, this
 * means that when called on an execution the variable will be stored on the process instance
 * execution. Variables can be stored on the actual scope itself though, by calling the xxLocal methods.
