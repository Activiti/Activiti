  /**
   * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-draggable      Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
   *                      of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
   *                      serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
   * - dnd-selected       Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged.
   *                      The original click event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Options:
   *                      - "move": The drag operation will move the element. This is the default.
   *                      - "copy": The drag operation will copy the element. Shows a copy cursor.
   *                      - "copyMove": The user can choose between copy and move by pressing the
   *                        ctrl or shift key. *Not supported in IE:* In Internet Explorer this
   *                        option will be the same as "copy". *Not fully supported in Chrome on
   *                        Windows:* In the Windows version of Chrome the cursor will always be the
   *                        move cursor. However, when the user drops an element and has the ctrl
   *                        key pressed, we will perform a copy anyways.
   *                      - HTML5 also specifies the "link" option, but this library does not
   *                        actively support it yet, so use it at your own risk.
   * - dnd-moved          Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will
   *                      remove your element from the original list in this callback, since the
   *                      directive is not doing that for you automatically. The original dragend
   *                      event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-copied         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
   *                      instead of moved. The original dragend event will be provided in the local
   *                      event variable.
   * - dnd-dragstart      Callback that is invoked when the element was dragged. The original
   *                      dragstart event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-type           Use this attribute if you have different kinds of items in your
   *                      application and you want to limit which items can be dropped into which
   *                      lists. Combine with dnd-allowed-types on the dnd-list(s). This attribute
   *                      should evaluate to a string, although this restriction is not enforced.
   * - dnd-disable-if     You can use this attribute to dynamically disable the draggability of the
   *                      element. This is useful if you have certain list items that you don't want
   *                      to be draggable, or if you want to disable drag & drop completely without
   *                      having two different code branches (e.g. only allow for admins).
   *                      **Note**: If your element is not draggable, the user is probably able to
   *                      select text or images inside of it. Since a selection is always draggable,
   *                      this breaks your UI. You most likely want to disable user selection via
   *                      CSS (see user-select).
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being
   *                      dragged. It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the
   *                      source element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source
   *                      element with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
   * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was
   *                      started, meaning it only affects the original element that is still at
   *                      it's source position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with
   *                      his mouse pointer.

   * Use the dnd-list attribute to make your list element a dropzone. Usually you will add a single
   * li element as child with the ng-repeat directive. If you don't do that, we will not be able to
   * position the dropped element correctly. If you want your list to be sortable, also add the
   * dnd-draggable directive to your li element(s). Both the dnd-list and it's direct children must
   * have position: relative CSS style, otherwise the positioning algorithm will not be able to
   * determine the correct placeholder position in all browsers.
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-list             Required attribute. The value has to be the array in which the data of
   *                        the dropped element should be inserted.
   * - dnd-allowed-types    Optional array of allowed item types. When used, only items that had a
   *                        matching dnd-type attribute will be dropable.
   * - dnd-disable-if       Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, no dropping
   *                        into the list is possible. Note that this also disables rearranging
   *                        items inside the list.
   * - dnd-horizontal-list  Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, the positioning
   *                        algorithm will use the left and right halfs of the list items instead of
   *                        the upper and lower halfs.
   * - dnd-dragover         Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dragged over the
   *                        list. If the expression is set, but does not return true, the element is
   *                        not allowed to be dropped. The following variables will be available:
   *                        - event: The original dragover event sent by the browser.
   *                        - index: The position in the list at which the element would be dropped.
   *                        - type: The dnd-type set on the dnd-draggable, or undefined if unset.
   * - dnd-drop             Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dropped over the
   *                        list. If the expression is set, it must return the object that will be
   *                        inserted into the list. If it returns false, the drop will be aborted
   *                        and the event is propagated. The following variables will be available:
   *                        - event: The original drop event sent by the browser.
   *                        - index: The position in the list at which the element would be dropped.
   *                        - item: The transferred object.
   *                        - type: The dnd-type set on the dnd-draggable, or undefined if unset.
   * - dnd-external-sources Optional boolean expression. When it evaluates to true, the list accepts
   *                        drops from sources outside of the current browser tab. This allows to
   *                        drag and drop accross different browser tabs. Note that this will allow
   *                        to drop arbitrary text into the list, thus it is highly recommended to
   *                        implement the dnd-drop callback to check the incoming element for
   *                        sanity. Furthermore, the dnd-type of external sources can not be
   *                        determined, therefore do not rely on restrictions of dnd-allowed-type.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndPlaceholder       When an element is dragged over the list, a new placeholder child
   *                        element will be added. This element is of type li and has the class
   *                        dndPlaceholder set.
   * - dndDragover          Will be added to the list while an element is dragged over the list.
