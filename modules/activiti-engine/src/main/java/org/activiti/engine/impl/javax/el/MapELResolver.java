/**
 * Defines property resolution behavior on instances of java.util.Map. This resolver handles base
 * objects of type java.util.Map. It accepts any object as a property and uses that object as a key
 * in the map. The resulting value is the value in the map that is associated with that key. This
 * resolver can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that isReadOnly will always return
 * true and {@link #setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)} will always throw
 * PropertyNotWritableException. ELResolvers are combined together using {@link CompositeELResolver}
 * s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression. See the javadocs for {@link ELResolver}
 * for details.
