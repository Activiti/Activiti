      Has to do with weak permissions on a config file in default installations of tomcat on linux systems.
      Note that the default packaged war of this application does not contain this dependency as it is designed
      to be deployed to an existing servlet container. Also, the -all version of the war should not experience
      this vulnerability as it is a self-contained executable which does not create the config file in question.
