== Spring integration

While you can definitely use Activiti without Spring, we've provided some very nice integration features that are explained in this chapter.

=== ProcessEngineFactoryBean

The +ProcessEngine+ can be configured as a regular Spring bean. The starting point of the integration is the class +org.activiti.spring.ProcessEngineFactoryBean+. That bean takes a process engine configuration and creates the process engine.  This means that the creation and configuration of properties for Spring is the same as documented in the <<configuration,configuration section>>. For Spring integration the configuration and engine beans will look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration">
    ...
</bean>

<bean id="processEngine" class="org.activiti.spring.ProcessEngineFactoryBean">
  <property name="processEngineConfiguration" ref="processEngineConfiguration" />
</bean>

----

Note that the +processEngineConfiguration+ bean now uses the +org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration+ class.


=== Transactions

We'll explain the +SpringTransactionIntegrationTest+ found in the Spring examples of the distribution step by step.   Below is the Spring configuration file that we use in this example  (you can find it in SpringTransactionIntegrationTest-context.xml). The section shown below  contains the dataSource, transactionManager, processEngine and the Activiti Engine services.


When passing the DataSource to the +SpringProcessEngineConfiguration+ (using property "dataSource"), Activiti uses a +org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy+ internally, which wraps the passed DataSource. This is done to make sure the SQL connections retrieved from the DataSource and the Spring transactions play well together. This implies that it's no longer needed to proxy the dataSource yourself in Spring configuration, although it's still allowed to pass a +TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy+ into the +SpringProcessEngineConfiguration+. In this case no additional wrapping will occur.

*Make sure when declaring a +TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy+ in Spring configuration yourself, that you don't use it for resources that are already aware of Spring-transactions (e.g. DataSourceTransactionManager and JPATransactionManager need the un-proxied dataSource).*

  <bean id="repositoryService" factory-bean="processEngine" factory-method="getRepositoryService" />
  <bean id="runtimeService" factory-bean="processEngine" factory-method="getRuntimeService" />
  <bean id="taskService" factory-bean="processEngine" factory-method="getTaskService" />
  <bean id="historyService" factory-bean="processEngine" factory-method="getHistoryService" />
  <bean id="managementService" factory-bean="processEngine" factory-method="getManagementService" />

...
----


The remainder of that Spring configuration file contains the beans and configuration that we'll use in this particular example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<beans>
  ...
  <tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="transactionManager"/>

  <bean id="userBean" class="org.activiti.spring.test.UserBean">
    <property name="runtimeService" ref="runtimeService" />
  </bean>

  <bean id="printer" class="org.activiti.spring.test.Printer" />

</beans>
----

First the application context is created with any of the Spring ways to do that. In this  example you could use a classpath XML resource to configure our Spring application context:

[source,java,linenums]
----
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
	"org/activiti/examples/spring/SpringTransactionIntegrationTest-context.xml");
----

or since it is a test:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@ContextConfiguration("classpath:org/activiti/spring/test/transaction/SpringTransactionIntegrationTest-context.xml")
----


Then we can get the service beans and invoke methods on them.  The ProcessEngineFactoryBean will have  added an extra interceptor to the services that applies Propagation.REQUIRED transaction semantics on  the Activiti service methods.  So, for example, we can use the repositoryService to deploy a process like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
RepositoryService repositoryService =
  (RepositoryService) applicationContext.getBean("repositoryService");
String deploymentId = repositoryService
  .createDeployment()
  .addClasspathResource("org/activiti/spring/test/hello.bpmn20.xml")
  .deploy()
  .getId();

----

The other way around also works.  In this case, the Spring transaction will  be around the userBean.hello() method and the Activiti service method invocation will join that  same transaction.

[source,java,linenums]
----
UserBean userBean = (UserBean) applicationContext.getBean("userBean");
userBean.hello();
----

The UserBean looks like this.  Remember from above in the Spring bean configuration we injected the  repositoryService into the userBean.

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class UserBean {

  /** injected by Spring */
  private RuntimeService runtimeService;

  @Transactional
  public void hello() {
    // here you can do transactional stuff in your domain model
    // and it will be combined in the same transaction as
    // the startProcessInstanceByKey to the Activiti RuntimeService
    runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("helloProcess");
  }

  public void setRuntimeService(RuntimeService runtimeService) {
    this.runtimeService = runtimeService;
  }
}
----

[[springExpressions]]


=== Expressions

When using the ProcessEngineFactoryBean, by default, all <<apiExpressions,expressions>> in the BPMN processes will also 'see' all the Spring beans. It's possible to limit the beans you want to expose in expressions or even exposing no beans at all using a map that you can configure.  The example below exposes a single bean (printer), available to use under the key "printer".  *To have NO beans exposed at all, just pass an empty list as 'beans' property on the SpringProcessEngineConfiguration. When no 'beans' property is set, all Spring beans in the context will be available.*

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration">
  ...
  <property name="beans">
    <map>
      <entry key="printer" value-ref="printer" />
    </map>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="printer" class="org.activiti.examples.spring.Printer" />
----

Now the exposed beans can be used in expressions: for example, the SpringTransactionIntegrationTest +hello.bpmn20.xml+ shows how a method on a Spring bean can be invoked using a UEL method expression:


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<definitions id="definitions">

  <process id="helloProcess">

    <startEvent id="start" />
    <sequenceFlow id="flow1" sourceRef="start" targetRef="print" />

    <serviceTask id="print" activiti:expression="#{printer.printMessage()}" />
    <sequenceFlow id="flow2" sourceRef="print" targetRef="end" />

    <endEvent id="end" />

  </process>

</definitions>
----

Where +Printer+ looks like this:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public class Printer {

  public void printMessage() {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }
}
----

And the Spring bean configuration (also shown above) looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<beans>
  ...

  <bean id="printer" class="org.activiti.examples.spring.Printer" />

</beans>
----



=== Automatic resource deployment

Spring integration also has a special feature for deploying resources.  In the process engine configuration, you can specify a set of resources. When the process engine is created, all those resources will be scanned and deployed.  There is filtering in place that prevents duplicate deployments.  Only when the resources actually have changed,  will new deployments be deployed to the Activiti DB. This makes sense in a lot of use case, where the Spring container is rebooted often (e.g. testing).

Here's an example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration" class="org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration">
  ...
  <property name="deploymentResources"
    value="classpath*:/org/activiti/spring/test/autodeployment/autodeploy.*.bpmn20.xml" />
</bean>

<bean id="processEngine" class="org.activiti.spring.ProcessEngineFactoryBean">
  <property name="processEngineConfiguration" ref="processEngineConfiguration" />
</bean>
----

By default, the configuration above will group all of the resources matching the filtering into a single deployment to the Activiti engine. The duplicate filtering to prevent re-deployment of unchanged  resources applies to the whole deployment. In some cases, this may not be what you want. For instance, if you deploy a set of process resources this way and only a single
 process definition in those resources has changed, the deployment as a whole will be considered new and all of the process definitions in that deployment will be re-deployed, resulting in new  versions of each of the process definitions, even though only one was actually changed.

To be able to customize the way deployments are determined, you can specify an additional property in the +SpringProcessEngineConfiguration+, +deploymentMode+. This  property defines the way deployments will be determined from the set of resources that match the filter. There are 3 values that are supported by default for this property:

* ++default++: Group all resources into a single deployment and apply duplicate filtering to that deployment. This is the default value and it will be used if you don't specify a value.
* ++single-resource++: Create a separate deployment for each individual resource and apply duplicate filtering to that deployment. This is the  value you would use to have each process definition be deployed separately and only create a new process definition version if it has changed.
* ++resource-parent-folder++: Create a separate deployment for resources that share the same parent folder and apply duplicate filtering to that  deployment. This value can be used to create separate deployments for most resources, but still be able to group some by placing them in a shared folder. Here's an example of how to specify the +single-resource+ configuration for ++deploymentMode++:


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration"
    class="org.activiti.spring.SpringProcessEngineConfiguration">
  ...
  <property name="deploymentResources" value="classpath*:/activiti/*.bpmn" />
  <property name="deploymentMode" value="single-resource" />
</bean>
----

In addition to using the values listed above for +deploymentMode+, you may require customized behavior towards determining deployments. If so,  you can create a subclass of +SpringProcessEngineConfiguration+ and override the +getAutoDeploymentStrategy(String deploymentMode)+ method.  This method determines which deployment strategy is used for a certain value of the +deploymentMode+ configuration.


[[springUnitTest]]


=== Unit testing

When integrating with Spring, business processes can be tested very easily using the standard <<apiUnitTesting,Activiti testing facilities>>. The following example shows how a business process is tested in a typical Spring-based unit test:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration("classpath:org/activiti/spring/test/junit4/springTypicalUsageTest-context.xml")
public class MyBusinessProcessTest {

  @Autowired
  private RuntimeService runtimeService;

  @Autowired
  private TaskService taskService;

  @Autowired
  @Rule
  public ActivitiRule activitiSpringRule;

  @Test
  @Deployment
  public void simpleProcessTest() {
    runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("simpleProcess");
    Task task = taskService.createTaskQuery().singleResult();
    assertEquals("My Task", task.getName());

    taskService.complete(task.getId());
    assertEquals(0, runtimeService.createProcessInstanceQuery().count());

  }
}
----

Note that for this to work, you need to define a _org.activiti.engine.test.ActivitiRule_ bean in the Spring configuration (which is injected by auto-wiring in the example above).

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="activitiRule" class="org.activiti.engine.test.ActivitiRule">
  <property name="processEngine" ref="processEngine" />
</bean>

----



=== JPA with Hibernate 4.2.x

When using Hibernate 4.2.x JPA in service task or listener logic in the Activiti Engine an additional dependency to Spring ORM is needed. This is not needed for Hibernate 4.1.x or lower. The following dependency should be added:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-orm</artifactId>
  <version>${org.springframework.version}</version>
</dependency>
----


[[springSpringBoot]]


=== Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an application framework which, according to link:$$http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/$$[its website], _makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that can you can "just run". It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration_.

For more information on Spring Boot, see link:$$http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/$$[http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/]

The Spring Boot - Activiti integration is currently experimental. It has been developer together with Spring committers, but it is still early days. We welcome all to try it out and provide feedback. 

==== Compatibility

Spring Boot requires a JDK 7 runtime. It can be made to work with JDK6, but it will need configuration tweaks. Please check the Spring Boot documentation.

==== Getting started

Spring Boot is all about convention over configuration. To get started, simply add the _spring-boot-starters-basic_ dependency to your project. For example for Maven:


[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.activiti</groupId>
	<artifactId>activiti-spring-boot-starter-basic</artifactId>
	<version>${activiti.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

That's all that's needed. This dependency will transitively add the correct Activiti and Spring dependencies to the classpath. You can now write the Spring Boot application:

[source,java,,linenums]
----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }

}
----

Activiti needs a database to store its data. If you would run the code above, it would give you an informative exception message that you need to add a database driver dependency to the classpath. For now, add the H2 database dependency:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
	<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
	<version>1.4.183</version>
</dependency>
----

The application can now be started. You will see output like this:

----
  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::        (v1.1.6.RELEASE)

MyApplication                            : Started MyApplication in 2.019 seconds (JVM running for 2.294)
----

So by just adding the dependency to the classpath and using the _@EnableAutoConfiguration_ annotation a lot has happened behind the scenes:

* An in-memory datasource is created automatically (since the H2 driver is on the classpath) and passed to the Activiti process engine configuration
* An Activiti ProcessEngine bean is created and exposed
* All the Activiti services are exposed as Spring beans
* The Spring Job Executor is created

Also, any BPMN 2.0 process definition in the _processes_ folder would be automatically deployed. Create a folder _processes_ and add a dummy process definition (named _one-task-process.bpmn20.xml_) to this folder. 

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<definitions
        xmlns="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL"
        xmlns:activiti="http://activiti.org/bpmn"
        targetNamespace="Examples">

    <process id="oneTaskProcess" name="The One Task Process">
        <startEvent id="theStart" />
        <sequenceFlow id="flow1" sourceRef="theStart" targetRef="theTask" />
        <userTask id="theTask" name="my task" />
        <sequenceFlow id="flow2" sourceRef="theTask" targetRef="theEnd" />
        <endEvent id="theEnd" />
    </process>

</definitions>
----

Also add following code lines to test if the deployment actually worked. The _CommandLineRunner_ is a special kind of Spring bean that is executed when the application boots:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner init(final RepositoryService repositoryService,
                                  final RuntimeService runtimeService,
                                  final TaskService taskService) {

        return new CommandLineRunner() {
            @Override
            public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
                System.out.println("Number of process definitions : " 
                	+ repositoryService.createProcessDefinitionQuery().count());
                System.out.println("Number of tasks : " + taskService.createTaskQuery().count());
                runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("oneTaskProcess");
                System.out.println("Number of tasks after process start: " + taskService.createTaskQuery().count());
            }
        };

    }

}
----

The output will be as expected:

----
Number of process definitions : 1
Number of tasks : 0
Number of tasks after process start : 1
----


==== Changing the database and connection pool

As stated above, Spring Boot is about convention over configuration. By default, by having only H2 on the classpath, it created an in memory datasource and passed that to the Activiti process engine configuration.

To change the datasource, simply override the default by providing a Datasource bean. We're using the _DataSourceBuilder_ class here, which is a helper class from Spring Boot. If Tomcat, HikariCP or Commons DBCP are on the classpath one of them will be selected (in that order with Tomcat first). For example, to switch to a MySQL database:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Bean
public DataSource database() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create()
        .url("jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/activiti-spring-boot?characterEncoding=UTF-8")
        .username("alfresco")
        .password("alfresco")
        .driverClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")
        .build();
}
----

Remove H2 from the Maven dependencies and add the MySQL driver and the Tomcat connection pooling to the classpath:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>mysql</groupId>
	<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
	<version>5.1.34</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
	<artifactId>tomcat-jdbc</artifactId>
	<version>8.0.15</version>
</dependency>
----

When the app is now booted up, you'll see it uses MySQL as database (and the Tomcat connection pooling framework):

----
org.activiti.engine.impl.db.DbSqlSession   : performing create on engine with resource org/activiti/db/create/activiti.mysql.create.engine.sql
org.activiti.engine.impl.db.DbSqlSession   : performing create on history with resource org/activiti/db/create/activiti.mysql.create.history.sql
org.activiti.engine.impl.db.DbSqlSession   : performing create on identity with resource org/activiti/db/create/activiti.mysql.create.identity.sql
----

When you reboot the application multiple times, you'll see the number of tasks go up (the H2 in-memory database does not survive a shutdown, the MySQL does).

==== REST support

Often, a REST API is needed on top of the embedded Activiti engine (interacting with the different services in a company). Spring Boot makes this really easy. Add following dependency to the classpath:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
	<version>${spring.boot.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Create a new class, a Spring service, and create two methods: one to start our process and one to get a task list for a given assignee. We simply wrap Activiti calls here, but in real-life scenario's this obviously will be more complex obviously.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private RuntimeService runtimeService;

    @Autowired
    private TaskService taskService;

	@Transactional
    public void startProcess() {
        runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("oneTaskProcess");
    }

	@Transactional
    public List<Task> getTasks(String assignee) {
        return taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee(assignee).list();
    }

}
----

We can now create a REST endpoint by annotating a class with _@RestController_. Here, we simply delegate to the service defined above.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @RequestMapping(value="/process", method= RequestMethod.POST)
    public void startProcessInstance() {
        myService.startProcess();
    }

    @RequestMapping(value="/tasks", method= RequestMethod.GET, produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public List<TaskRepresentation> getTasks(@RequestParam String assignee) {
        List<Task> tasks = myService.getTasks(assignee);
        List<TaskRepresentation> dtos = new ArrayList<TaskRepresentation>();
        for (Task task : tasks) {
            dtos.add(new TaskRepresentation(task.getId(), task.getName()));
        }
        return dtos;
    }

    static class TaskRepresentation {

        private String id;
        private String name;

        public TaskRepresentation(String id, String name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }
        
         public String getId() {
            return id;
        }
        public void setId(String id) {
            this.id = id;
        }
        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }
        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

    }

}
----

Both the _@Service_ and the _@RestController_ will be found by the automatic component scan (_@ComponentScan_) we added to our application class. Run the application class again. We can now interact with the REST API by using for example cURL:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks?assignee=kermit
[]

curl -X POST  http://localhost:8080/process
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks?assignee=kermit
[{"id":"10004","name":"my task"}]
----


==== JPA support

To add in JPA support for Activiti in Spring Boot, add following dependency:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.activiti</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jpa</artifactId>
	<version>${activiti.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This will add in the Spring configuration and beans for using JPA. By default the JPA provider will be Hibernate.

Let's create a simple Entity class:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Entity
class Person {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String username;

    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    private Date birthDate;

    public Person() {
    }

    public Person(String username, String firstName, String lastName, Date birthDate) {
        this.username = username;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.birthDate = birthDate;
    }

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public Date getBirthDate() {
        return birthDate;
    }

    public void setBirthDate(Date birthDate) {
        this.birthDate = birthDate;
    }
}

By default, when not using an in-memory database, the tables won't be created automatically. Create a file _application.properties_ on the classpath and add following property:

----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
----

Add following class:

[source,java,linenums]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository<Person, Long> {

    Person findByUsername(String username);

}
----

This is a Spring repository, which offers CRUD out of the box. We add the method to find a Person by username. Spring will automagically implement this based on conventions (i.e. the property names used).

We now enhance our service further:

* by adding _@Transactional_ to the class. Note that by adding the JPA dependency above, the DataSourceTransactionManager which we were using before is now automatically swapped out by a JpaTransactionManager. 
* The _startProcess_ now gets an assignee username in, which is used to look up the Person, and put the Person JPA object as a process variable in the process instance.
* A method to create Dummy users is added. This is used in the CommandLineRunner to populate the database.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Service
@Transactional
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private RuntimeService runtimeService;

    @Autowired
    private TaskService taskService;

    @Autowired
    private PersonRepository personRepository;

    public void startProcess(String assignee) {

        Person person = personRepository.findByUsername(assignee);

        Map<String, Object> variables = new HashMap<String, Object>();
        variables.put("person", person);
        runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("oneTaskProcess", variables);
    }

    public List<Task> getTasks(String assignee) {
        return taskService.createTaskQuery().taskAssignee(assignee).list();
    }

    public void createDemoUsers() {
		 if (personRepository.findAll().size() == 0) {
            personRepository.save(new Person("jbarrez", "Joram", "Barrez", new Date()));
            personRepository.save(new Person("trademakers", "Tijs", "Rademakers", new Date()));
        }
    }

}
----

The CommandLineRunner now looks like:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner init(final MyService myService) {

	return new CommandLineRunner() {
    	public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
        	myService.createDemoUsers();
        }
    };

}
----

The RestController is also slightly changed to incorporate the changes above (only showing new methods) and the HTTP POST now has a body that contains the assignee username:

----
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @RequestMapping(value="/process", method= RequestMethod.POST)
    public void startProcessInstance(@RequestBody StartProcessRepresentation startProcessRepresentation) {
        myService.startProcess(startProcessRepresentation.getAssignee());
    }

   ...

    static class StartProcessRepresentation {

        private String assignee;

        public String getAssignee() {
            return assignee;
        }

        public void setAssignee(String assignee) {
            this.assignee = assignee;
        }
    }
----

And lastly, to try out the Spring-JPA-Activiti integration, we assign the task using the id of the Person JPA object in the process definition:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<userTask id="theTask" name="my task" activiti:assignee="${person.id}"/>
----

We can now start a new process instance, providing the user name in the POST body:

----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"assignee" : "jbarrez"}' http://localhost:8080/process
----

And the task list is now fetched using the person id:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/tasks?assignee=1

[{"id":"12505","name":"my task"}]
----

==== Further Reading

Obviously there is a lot about Spring Boot that hasn't been touched yet, like very easy JTA integration or building a war file that can be run on major application servers. And there is a lot more to the Spring Boot integration: 

* Actuator support
* Spring Integration support
* Rest API integration: boot up the Activiti Rest API embedded within the Spring application
* Spring Security support

All these areas are a first version at the moment, but they will evolved in the future further.
