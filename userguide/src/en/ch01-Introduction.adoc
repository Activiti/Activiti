[[experimental]]

=== Experimental features

Sections marked with *[EXPERIMENTAL]* should
  not be considered stable.


All classes that have +.impl.+ in the package name are internal implementation classes and cannot be considered stable.  However, if the user guide mentions those classes as configuration values, they are supported and can be considered stable.


[[internal]]

=== Internal implementation classes

In the jar file, all classes in packages that have +.impl.+ (e.g. ++org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.delegate++) in them are implementation classes and should be considered internal. No stability guarantees are given on classes or interfaces that are in implementation classes.
