  <title>Activiti Cycle</title>
  
  <para>
    Activiti Cycle is a web application that aims to provide a collaborative platform for business stakeholders, developers and IT operations people. It combines different repositories like the Activiti Modeler repository, Subversion or your local file system into a single view, which makes it easy to browse all the artifacts that are involved in the process of creating an executable business process. In addition to this, Activiti Cycle provides built in actions like moving artifacts between repositories or downloading different formats of process models, and a plug-in infrastructure for custom actions. Below is a screen shot of Cycle in the standard configuration as pre-configured in the demo setup.

    <title>Overview</title>  
    <para>
      Since Activiti Cycle is meant to be used by people with entirely different roles, backgrounds and requirements, it was build with customization and extensibility in mind. However, the plug-in infrastructure which is already present in the current release is just a first step to make it possible to tailor Cycle to your specific needs. Future versions will provide a revised plug-in mechanism, a user interface to configure and plug in repositories, tags to dynamically add meta data to artifacts and a commenting function to directly collaborate on an artifact level. You can find a brief introduction to the initial version of Activiti Cycle and the vision behind it in the article <ulink url="http://www.bpm-guide.de/2010/08/27/activiti-cycle-explained/">Activiti Cycle explained</ulink>.

    <para>
      The above image shows the Activiti Cycle repository tree. By default it provides access to the repository of the Activiti Modeler and a demo Eclipse workspace which is located at <literal>${activiti.home}/apps/eclipse-workspace</literal> in your local file system. The repositories are plugged in as repository connectors which are currently configured via an xml file. You'll find the configuration file in the <literal>bin</literal> directory of the tomcat installation. Here is the default configuration for the user kermit:

        &lt;name&gt;kermit&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;linkedConnectors&gt;

          &lt;org.activiti.cycle.impl.connector.signavio.SignavioConnectorConfiguration&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Activiti Modeler&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;credentialsSaved&gt;false&lt;/credentialsSaved&gt;
            &lt;signavioBaseUrl&gt;http://localhost:8080/activiti-modeler/p/&lt;/signavioBaseUrl&gt;
            &lt;loginRequired&gt;false&lt;/loginRequired&gt;
          &lt;/org.activiti.cycle.impl.connector.signavio.SignavioConnectorConfiguration&gt;

          &lt;org.activiti.cycle.impl.connector.fs.FileSystemConnectorConfiguration&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;Files&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;baseFilePath&gt;/path-to-activiti-home/activiti-5.0.beta1/apps/eclipse-workspace&lt;/baseFilePath&gt;
          &lt;/org.activiti.cycle.impl.connector.fs.FileSystemConnectorConfiguration&gt;

        &lt;/linkedConnectors&gt;

      Now if e.g. you want to add an enterprise Signavio Process Modeler repository, you can simply do this by adding a connector configuration to the xml file. If you need a Signavio account, you can register for a free trial at the <ulink url="http://www.signavio.com">Signavio web site</ulink>. Here is an example configuration:

      &lt;org.activiti.cycle.impl.connector.signavio.SignavioConnectorConfiguration&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Signavio&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;credentialsSaved&gt;true&lt;/credentialsSaved&gt;
        &lt;user&gt;your user name&lt;/user&gt;
        &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt;
        &lt;loginRequired&gt;true&lt;/loginRequired&gt;

    <title>Artifacts and Actions</title>
    <para>
      When you click an item in the repository tree — in Activiti Cycle we refer to them as artifacts — the details are displayed on the right side. Currently, not all files are supported, but we aim to provide useful default views for the most common file types. In addition to the views, there is a set of actions that can be executed on the artifact. We currently distinguish between download links for different content representations, links that open external resources (e.g. the Signavio Modeler) and actions that require input properties.
