      <title>Installation and Authentication</title>
      
      <para>Activiti includes a REST API to the Activiti Engine that can be installed by deploying the activiti-rest.war file to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat. However, it can also be used in another web-application by including the servlet and it's mapping in your application and add all activiti-rest dependencies to the classpath.</para>
      <para>By default the Activiti Engine will connect to an in-memory H2 database. You can change the database settings in the db.properties file in the WEB-INF/classes folder. The REST API uses JSON format (http://www.json.org) and is built upon the Restlet (http://www.restlet.org).</para>
      <para>All REST-resources require a valid Activiti-user to be authenticated by default. Basic HTTP access authentication is used, so you should always include a <literal>Authorization: Basic ...==</literal> HTTP-header when performing requests or include the username and password in the request-url (eg. <literal>http://username:password@localhost...</literal>).
      </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">It's recommended to use Basic Authentication in combination with HTTPS.</emphasis></para>
      <para>It's possible to remove authentication from certain resources or adding additional authorisation on top of being an authenticated user (eg. being part of group X allows a user to execute request with URL Y). 
      This can be achieved by using an implementation of <literal>org.activiti.rest.common.filter.RestAuthenticator</literal> which has 2 methods:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis><literal>boolean requestRequiresAuthentication(Request request)</literal></emphasis>: Called before a request is checked for authentication (valid username and password is passed in header). If this method returns true, the method needs authentication. If false is returned, the request will be done regardless of the request being authenticated. If false is returned, <literal>isRequestAuthorized</literal> will not be called either for this request.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis><literal>boolean isRequestAuthorized(Request request)</literal></emphasis>: Called after a user is successfully authenticated against the Activiti identity-management but before the request is actually executed. Can be used to check if a certain request is valid for the authenticated user. If true is returned, the request is considered authorised and is executed. When false is returned, the request is not executed and the client gets an appropriate error.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>The custom RestAuthenticator should be set on the <literal>org.activiti.rest.service.application.ActivitiRestServicesApplication</literal>that is used in the RestletServlet. 
      The easiest way for this to create a subclass of the <literal>ActivitiRestServicesApplication</literal> and use the custom implementation classname in the servlet-mapping:</para>

      This may have an impact on the deployment resources and their data-URL, as the URL can potentially contain escaped forward slashes.

            need to be properly escaped (see <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL-encoding or Percent-encoding</ulink>) in case the segment contains special characters. Most
            frameworks have this functionality built in, but it should be taken into account. Especially for segments that can contains forward-slashes (eg. deployment resource), this is required.

        <title>Variable representation</title>
        <para>
          When working with variables (execution/process and task), the REST-api uses some common principles and JSON-format for both reading and writing. The JSON representation of a variable looks like this:
           <programlisting>
{ 
  "name" : "variableName",
  "value" : "variableValue",
  "valueUrl" : "http://...",
  "scope" : "local",
  "type" : "string"
}</programlisting>

            It's possible to support additional variable-types with a custom JSON representation (either simple value or complex/nested JSON object). By extending the <literal>initializeVariableConverters()</literal> method on <literal>org.activiti.rest.service.api.RestResponseFactory</literal>,
            you can add additional <literal>org.activiti.rest.service.api.engine.variable.RestVariableConverter</literal> classes to support converting your POJO's to a format suitable for transerring through REST and converting the REST-value back to your POJO. The actual transformation to JSON is done by Jackson.

When an attribute is explicitly included and is set to null, the model-value will be updated to null. Example: <literal>{"metaInfo" : null}</literal> will clear the metaInfo of the model).

      All request values are optional. For example, you can only include the 'assignee' attribute in the request body JSON-object, only updating the assignee of the task, leaving all other fields unaffected. When an attribute is explicitly included and is set to null, the task-value will be updated to null. Example: <literal>{"dueDate" : null}</literal> will clear the duedate of the task).

        All supported JSON parameter fields allowed are exactly the same as the parameters found for <link linkend="restHistoricProcessInstancesGet">getting a collection of historic process instances</link>, but passed in as JSON-body arguments rather than URL-parameters to allow for more advanced querying and preventing errors with request-uri's that are too long. On top of that, the query allows
        for filtering based on process variables. The <literal>variables</literal> property is a json-array containing objects with the format <link linkend="restQueryVariable"> as described here.</link>

      All request values are optional. For example, you can only include the 'firstName' attribute in the request body JSON-object, only updating the firstName of the user, leaving all other fields unaffected. When an attribute is explicitly included and is set to null, the user-value will be updated to null. Example: <literal>{"firstName" : null}</literal> will clear the firstName of the user).

      All request values are optional. For example, you can only include the 'name' attribute in the request body JSON-object, only updating the name of the group, leaving all other fields unaffected. When an attribute is explicitly included and is set to null, the group-value will be updated to null.

    <title>Legacy REST - General Usage</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The folowing section contains documentation of the Legacy REST-api, which has been deprecated since the 5.15-SNAPSHOT release. The REST-urls will not be removed in the future but will not be maintained. Any future additions and improvements will be done to the new REST API.</emphasis></para>
    <para>
      Activiti includes a REST API to the Activiti Engine that can be installed by deploying the activiti-rest.war file to a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.
      By default the Activiti Engine will connect to a standalone H2 database. You can change the database settings in the db.properties file in the WEB-INF/classes folder.
      The REST API uses JSON format (http://www.json.org) and is built upon the Restlet (http://www.restlet.org).
    </para>

    <para>
      Each REST API call has its individual authorization level and you must be logged in as a user to invoke a REST API
      call (except for the /login service). Authentication is done using Basic HTTP Authentication, so if you logged in as
      an admin (i.e. kermit) you should be able to perform all calls as described below.
    </para>

    <para>
      The API follows normal REST API conventions using GET for read operations, POST for creating objects, PUT for updating and
      performing operations on already created objects and finally DELETE for deleting objects. When performing a call
      that affects multiple objects POST is used on all such operations for consistency and making sure that an unlimited
      number of objects may be used. The reason for using POST is that the HTTP DELETE method doesn't implicitly allow
      request bodies and therefore, a call using DELETE, in theory, could get it's request body stripped out by a proxy.
      So to be certain this doesn't happen we use POST, even when PUT could have been used to update multiple objects,
      for consistency.
    </para>

    <para>
      All rest calls use a content type of "application/json" (except for upload requests which uses "multipart/form-data").
    </para>

    <para>
      The base URL for invoking a REST call is http://localhost:8080/activiti-rest/service/.
      So for example to list the process definitions in the engine point your browser to:
      http://localhost:8080/activiti-rest/service/process-definitions
    </para>

    <para>
      You may also use curl to run queries against the REST API, e.g.:
      <programlisting>curl --basic --user kermit:kermit http://localhost:8080/activiti-rest/service/tasks?assignee=kermit</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Please look below to see what REST API calls that currently are available.
      Please consider the "API" sections as a "one line hint" to what functionality of the core API that is used to implement the REST API call.
