  <para>
  	Activiti comes with an Eclipse plugin, the Activiti Eclipse Designer, that can be used to
    graphically model, test and deploy BPMN 2.0 processes. The Activiti tool stack offers two modeling / design tools
    with the <link linkend="activitiModeler">Activiti Modeler</link> and the Activiti Designer. You can of course use these tools in your own way, but a common way 
    of working is to use the Activiti Modeler for high level modeling. There should be no technical knowledge necessary to
    model a process definition with the Activiti Modeler. The Activiti Designer can then be used to add the necessary
    technical details, like Java service tasks, execution listeners etc. With the import functionality of the Activiti Designer
    this workflow is well supported.
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Please note: Activiti Designer is still in a "beta" state.</emphasis> This means that we don't yet
    support version compatibility. Although, with the BPMN 2.0 XML support of the Activiti Designer you should be able to
    upgrade your process definitions to new versions of the Activiti Designer quite easily. Also note that not all BPMN 2.0 
    constructs that are supported by the Activiti Engine are supported in the Activiti Designer.

          	BPMN 2.0 XML files can be imported into the Activiti Designer and a diagram will be created. There are two ways
          	supported to import a BPMN 2.0 XML file. One is to right-click on the Activiti project in the package explorer
          	and choose the <emphasis>Import BPMN 2.0 file</emphasis> option at the bottom of the popup menu. Then you can choose
          	the BPMN 2.0 XML via the file select dialog and the diagram is created. A second option is to import the BPMN 2.0 XML
          	file to the src/main/resources/diagrams folder of your project (the filename should end with .bpmn20.xml). Then when
          	you open the BPMN 2.0 XML file the diagram is created. Note that the Activiti Designer is able to read the BPMN DI
          	information from the BPMN 2.0 XML file, but in this version the diagram is created by parsing and analyzing the
          	BPMN 2.0 XML only, because this gives the best result. This means that import support is available even for BPMN
          	2.0 XML files without BPMN DI information.

          not required, but you can use a specific property in the manifest to provide a name for

        <para>Wait until the build is successful. Refresh the project (use the project's context

        <note>
          <para>You can of course also use the <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/m2e"
              >m2eclipse</ulink> plugin and simply enable Maven dependency management from the

      <section>
        <title>Adding shapes to the palette</title>
        <para>With your project set up, you can now easily add shapes to the palette. Each shape you
          wish to add is represented by a class in your JAR. Take note that these classes are not
          the classes that will be used by the Activiti engine during runtime. In your extension you
          describe the properties that can be set in Activiti Designer for each shape. From these
          shapes, your refer to the runtime class that should be used by the engine. This class
          should implement JavaDelegate as for any ServiceTask in Activiti.</para>
        <para>A shape's class is a simple Java class, to which a number of annotations are added.
          The class should implement the <literal>CustomServiceTask</literal> interface, but you
          shouldn't implement this interface yourself. Extend the
            <literal>AbstractCustomServiceTask</literal> base class instead (at the moment you MUST
          extend this class directly, so no abstract classes in between). In the Javadoc for that
          class you can find instructions on the defaults it provides and when you should override
          any of the methods it already implements. Overrides allow you to do things such as
          providing icons for the palette and in the shape on the canvas (these can be different)
          and specifying the base shape you want the node to have (activity, event, gateway).</para>

        </para>
        <para>You will need to implement the <literal>getName()</literal> method to determine the
          name the node will have in the palette. You can also put the nodes in their own drawer and
          provide an icon. Override the appropriate methods from
            <literal>AbstractCustomServiceTask</literal>. If you want to provide an icon, make sure
          it's in the <literal>src/main/resources</literal> package in your JAR and is about 16x16
          pixels and a JPEG or PNG format. The path you supply is relative to that folder.</para>
        <para>You can add properties to the shape by adding members to the class and annotating them
          with the <literal>@Property</literal> annotation like this:</para>

          <programlisting>@Property(type = PropertyType.TEXT, displayName = "Account Number")

private String accountNumber;</programlisting>

        <para>There are several <literal>PropertyType</literal> values you can use, which are
          described in more detail in <link linkend="eclipseDesignerPropertyTypes">this section</link>. You
          can make a field required by setting the required attribute to true. A message and red
          background will appear if the user doesn't fill out the field.</para>
        <para>If you want to ensure the order of the various properties in your class as they appear
          in the property screen, you should specify the order attribute of the
            <literal>@Property</literal> annotation.</para>
        <para>As you can see, there's also an <literal>@Help</literal> annotation that's used to
          provide the user some guidance when filling out the field. You can also use the
            <literal>@Help</literal> annotation on the class itself - this information is shown at
          the top of the property sheet presented to the user.</para>
        <para>Below is the listing for a further elaboration of the <literal>MoneyTask</literal>. A
          comment field has been added and you can see an icon is included for the node.</para>

          <title>PropertyType.DATA_GRID</title>
          <para>Creates a data grid control as shown below. A data grid can be used to allow the
            user to enter an arbitrary amount of rows of data and enter values for a fixed set of
            columns in each of those rows (each individual combination of row and column is referred
            to as a cell). Rows can be added and removed as the user sees fit.</para>
          <para>This property type expects the class member you have annotated to also have an
            accompanying <literal>@DataGridProperty</literal> annotation (for an example, see
            below). Using this additional annotation, you can specify some specific attributes of
            the data grid. You are required to reference a different class to determine which
            columns go into the grid with the <literal>itemClass</literal> attribute. Activiti
            Designer expects the member type to be a <literal>List</literal>. By convention, you can
            use the class of the <literal>itemClass</literal> attribute as its generic type. If, for
            example, you have a grocery list that you edit in the grid, you would define the columns
            of the grid in the <literal>GroceryListItem</literal> class. From your
              <literal>CustomServiceTask</literal>, you would refer to it like this:</para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>@Property(type = PropertyType.DATA_GRID, displayName = "Grocery List")
@DataGridProperty(itemClass = GroceryListItem.class)
private List&lt;GroceryListItem> groceryList;</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>The "itemClass" class uses the same annotations you would otherwise use to specify
            fields of a <literal>CustomServiceTask</literal>, with the exception of using a data
            grid. Specifically, <literal>TEXT</literal>, <literal>MULTILINE_TEXT</literal> and
              <literal>PERIOD</literal> are currently supported. You'll notice the grid will create
            single line text controls for each field, regardless of the
              <literal>PropertyType</literal>. This is done on purpose to keep the grid graphically
            appealing and readable. If you consider the regular display mode for a
              <literal>PERIOD</literal>
            <literal>PropertyType</literal> for instance, you can imagine it would never properly
            fit in a grid cell without cluttering the screen. For <literal>MULTILINE_TEXT</literal>
            and <literal>PERIOD</literal>, a double-click mechanism is added to each field which
            pops up a larger editor for the <literal>PropertyType</literal>. The value is stored to
            the field after the user clicks OK and is therefore readable within the grid.</para>
          <para>Required attributes are handled in a similar manner to regular fields of type
              <literal>TEXT</literal> and the entire grid is validated as soon as any field loses
            focus. The background color of the text control in a specific cell of the data grid is
            changed to light red if there are validation failures.</para>
          <para>By default, the component allows the user to add rows, but not to determine the
            order of those rows. If you wish to allow this, you should set the
              <literal>orderable</literal> attribute to true, which enables buttons at the end of
            each row to move it up or down in the grid. <note>
              <para>At the moment, this property type is not correctly injected into your runtime
                class.</para>

        <title>Disabling default shapes in the palette</title>
        <para>This customization requires you to include a class in your extension that implements
          the <literal>DefaultPaletteCustomizer</literal> interface. You should not implement this
          interface directly, but subclass the <literal>AbstractDefaultPaletteCustomizer</literal>
          base class. Currently, this class provides no functionality, but future versions of the
            <literal>DefaultPaletteCustomizer</literal> interface will offer more capabilities for
          which this base class will provide some sensible defaults so it's best to subclass so your
          extension will be compatible with future releases. </para>
        <para>Extending the <literal>AbstractDefaultPaletteCustomizer</literal> class requires you
          to implement one method, <literal>disablePaletteEntries()</literal>, from which you must
          return a list of <literal>PaletteEntry</literal> values. For each of the default shapes,
          you can disable it by adding its corresponding <literal>PaletteEntry</literal> value to
          your list. Note that if you remove shapes from the default set and there are no remaining
          shapes in a particular drawer, that drawer will be removed from the palette in its
          entirety. If you wish to disable all of the default shapes, you only need to add
            <literal>PaletteEntry.ALL</literal> to your result. As an example, the code below
          disables the Manual task and Script task shapes in the palette.</para>

      <title>Validating diagrams and exporting to custom output formats</title>
      <para>Besides customizing the palette, you can also create extensions to Activiti Designer
        that can perform validations and save information from the diagram to custom resources in
        the Eclipse workspace. There are built-in extension points for doing this and this section
        explains how to use them.</para>
      <para>Activiti Designer allows you to write extensions that validate diagrams. There are
        already validations of BPMN constructs in the tool by default, but you can add your own if
        you want to validate additional items such as modeling conventions or the values in
        properties of <literal>CustomServiceTask</literal>s. These extensions are known as
          <literal>Process Validators</literal>.</para>
      <para>You can also Activiti Designer to publish to additional formats when saving diagrams.
        These extensions are called <literal>Export Marshallers</literal> and are invoked
        automatically by Activiti Designer on each save action by the user. This behavior can be
        enabled or disabled by setting a preference in Eclipse's preferences dialog for each format
        to be saved.</para>
      <para>You can compare these extensions to the BPMN 2.0 validation, BPMN 2.0 export and process
        image saving that's performed during save actions by default in Activiti Designer. In fact,
        these functions use exactly the same extension features you can use to save to your own
        formats.</para>
      <para>Often, you will want to combine a <literal>ProcessValidator</literal> and an
          <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>. Let's say you have a number of
          <literal>CustomServiceTask</literal>s in use that have properties you would like to use in
        the process that gets generated. However, before the process is generated, you want to
        validate some of those values first. Combining a <literal>ProcessValidator</literal> and
          <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal> is the best way to accomplish this and Activiti
        Designer enables you to plug your extensions into the tool seamlessly.</para>
      <para>To create a <literal>ProcessValidator</literal> or an
          <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>, you need to create a different kind of extension than
        for extending the palette. The reason for this is simple: from your code you will need
        access to more APIs than are offered by the integration library. In particular, you will
        need classes that are available in Eclipse itself. So to get started, you should create an
        Eclipse plugin (which you can do by using Eclipse's PDE support) and package it in a custom
        Eclipse product or feature. It's beyond the scope of this user guide to explain all the
        details involved in developing Eclipse plugins, so the instructions below are limited to the
        functionality for extending Activiti Designer.</para>
      <para>Your bundle should be dependent on the following libraries:</para>
      <para>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/designer.export.dependencies.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </para>
      <para>Both <literal>ProcessValidator</literal>s and <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>s are
        created by extending a base class. These base classes inherit some useful methods fromt heir
        superclass, the <literal>AbstractDiagramWorker</literal> class. Using these methods you can
        create information, warning and error markers that show up in Eclipse's problems view for
        the user to figure out what's wrong or important. You can also access the diagram through
          <literal>Resources</literal> and <literal>InputStreams</literal> for the diagram's content
        using these methods in the <literal>AbstractDiagramWorker</literal> class.</para>
      <para>It's probably a good idea to invoke <literal>clearMarkers()</literal> as one of the
        first things you do in either a <literal>ProcessValidator</literal> or an
          <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>; this will clear any previous markers for your worker
        (markers are automatically linked to the worker and clearing markers for one worker leaves
        other markers untouched). For example:</para>
      <para>
        <programlisting>// Clear markers for this diagram first
clearMarkers(getResource(diagram.eResource().getURI()));</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>You should also use the progress monitor provided to report your progress back to the
        user because validations and/or marshalling actions can take up some time during which the
        user is forced to wait. Reporting progress requires some knowledge of how you should use
        Eclipse's features. Take a look at <ulink
          url="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html">this
          article</ulink> for a thorough explanation of the concepts and usage.</para>

          <programlisting>public class AcmeProcessValidator extends AbstractProcessValidator {

        </para>
        <para>You have to implement a number of methods. Most importantly, implement
            <literal>getValidatorId()</literal> so you return a globally unique ID for your
          validator. This will enable you to invoke it from and <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>,
          or event let someone <emphasis>else</emphasis> invoke your validator from their
            <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>. Implement <literal>getValidatorName()</literal> and
          return a logical name for your validator. This name is shown to the user in dialogs. In
            <literal>getFormatName()</literal>, you can return the type of diagram the validator
          typically validates.</para>
        <para>The validation work itself is done in the <literal>validateDiagram()</literal> method.
          From this point on, it's up to your specific functionality what you code here. Typically,
          however, you will want to start by getting hold of the nodes in the diagram's process, so
          you can iterate through them, collect, compare and validate data. This snippet shows you
          how to do this:</para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>final EList&lt;EObject> contents = getResourceForDiagram(diagram).getContents();
for (final EObject object : contents) {
  if (object instanceof StartEvent ) {
  // Perform some validations for StartEvents
  }
  // Other node types and validations
}</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>Don't forget to invoke <literal>addProblemToDiagram()</literal> and/or
            <literal>addWarningToDiagram()</literal>, etc as you go through your validations. Make
          sure you return a correct boolean result at the end to indicate whether you consider the
          validation as succeeded or failed. This can be used by and invoking
            <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal> to determine the next course of action.</para>

        <para>If you want to perform a certain validation first, you can invoke the validator
          directly from your marshaller. You receive a boolean result from the validator, so you
          know whether validation succeeded. In most cases you won't want to proceed with
          marshalling the diagram if it's not valid, but you might choose to go ahead anyway or even
          create a different resource if validation fails. For example:</para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>final boolean validDiagram = invokeValidator(AcmeConstants.ACME_VALIDATOR_ID, diagram, monitor);
if (!validDiagram) { 
  addProblemToDiagram(diagram, "Marshalling to " + getFormatName() + " format was skipped because validation of the diagram failed.", null);
} else {
  //proceed with marshalling
}</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>As you can see, here we have chosen to cancel the marshalling if the validator
          (identified by a constant here) returns false as result. We have also added an additional
          marker to the diagram so the user can see an explanation why the file wasn't created. This
          is not required, but seems helpful to the user and shows how you can use these utilities
          from both <literal>ProcessValidator</literal>s and <literal>ExportMarshaller</literal>s. </para>
        <para>Once you have all the data you need, you should invoke the
            <literal>saveResource()</literal> method to create a file containing your data. You can
          invoke <literal>saveResource()</literal> as many times as you wish from a single
            <markup>ExportMarshaller</markup>; a marshaller can therefore be used to create more
          than one output file.</para>
        <para>You can construct a filename for your output resource(s) by using some of the methods
          in the <literal>AbstractDiagramWorker</literal> class. There are a couple of useful
          variables you can have parsed, allowing you to create filenames such as
          &lt;original-filename>_&lt;my-format-name>.xml. These variables are described in the
          Javadocs, but here's an example how to use one of them:</para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>private static final String FILENAME_PATTERN = ExportMarshaller.PLACEHOLDER_ORIGINAL_FILENAME + ".acme.axml";
...
saveResource(getRelativeURIForDiagram(diagram, FILENAME_PATTERN), bais, this.monitor);</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>What happens here is that a static member is used to describe the filename pattern
          (this is just a best practice, you can specify the string any way you like of course) and
          the pattern uses the <literal>ExportMarshaller.PLACEHOLDER_ORIGINAL_FILENAME</literal>
          constant to insert a variable for the original filename. Later on in the
            <literal>marshallDiagram()</literal> method,
            <literal>getRelativeURIForDiagram()</literal> is invoked and it will parse the filename
          for any variables and substitute them. You provide <literal>saveResource()</literal> with
          an <literal>InputStream</literal> to your data and it will save the data to a resource
          with a relative path to the original diagram.</para>
        <para>Again, you should also use the progress monitor provided to report your progress back
          to the user. How to do this is described in <ulink
            url="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html">this
            article</ulink>.</para>
