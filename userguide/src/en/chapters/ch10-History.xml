  <title>History</title>

  <para>History is the component that captures what happened
  during process execution and stores it permanently.  In contrast to the runtime data, 
  the history data will remain present in the DB also after process instances have completed.
  </para>
  <para>Currently, there are 2 history tables: <literal>ACT_HI_PROC_INST</literal> containing 
  a record for every process instance and <literal>ACT_HI_ACT_INST</literal> containing a record
  for every execution of an activity.
  </para>
  <para>In the API, the HistoryService exposes this information by offering methods 
  <literal>createHistoricProcessInstanceQuery</literal> and <literal>createHistoricActivityInstanceQuery</literal>.
  You might want to consider these querying these tables in order to minimize access to the runtime process instance data 
  and that way keeping the runtime execution performant.
  </para>
  <para>Later on, this information will be exposed in Activiti Explorer and Activiti Probe.
  Also, it will be the information from which the reports will be generated.
  </para>
