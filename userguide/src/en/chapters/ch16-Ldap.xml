    <title>LDAP integration</title>

    <para>
        Companies often already have a user and group store in the form of an LDAP system.
        Since version 5.14, Activiti offers an out-of-the-box solution for easily configuring 
        how Activiti should connect with an LDAP system.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
       Before Activiti 5.14, it was already possible to integrate LDAP with Activiti.
       However, as of 5.14, the configuration has been simplified a lot. However, the 'old' way
       of configuring LDAP still works. More specifically, the simplified configuration is
       just a wrapper on top of the 'old' infrastructure.

        <title>Usage</title>
        
        <para>
            To add the LDAP integration code to your project, simply add the following
            dependency to your pom.xml:
            <programlisting>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.activiti&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;activiti-ldap&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;latest.version&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

        <title>Use cases</title>
        
        <para>
            The LDAP integration has currently two main use cases:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Allow for authentication through the IdentityService. This is eg. useful when using Activiti Explorer
                        and the login needs to go through LDAP.

                        Fetching the groups of a user. This is important when for example querying tasks
                        to see which tasks a certain user can see (ie. tasks with a candidate group).

        <title>Configuration</title>

        <para>
            Integrating the LDAP system with Activiti is done by injecting an instance
            of <literal>org.activiti.ldap.LDAPConfigurator</literal> in the <literal>configurators</literal>
            section of the process engine configuration. This class is highly extensible: methods
            can be easily overridden and many dependent beans are pluggable
            if the default implementation would not fit the use case.
        </para>
            
        <para>
            This is an example configuration (note: of course, when
            creating the engine programmatically this is completely similar). Don't worry about all
            the properties for now, we'll look at them in detail in a next section.

                            <entry>
                            The query that is executed when searching for a user by userId. 
                            For example: (&amp;(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid={0}))
                            Here, all the objects in LDAP with the class 'inetOrgPerson'
                            and who have the matching 'uid' attribute value will be returned.
                            As shown in the example, the user id is injected by using
                            {0}. If setting the query alone is insufficient for your specific
                            LDAP setup, you can alternatively plug in a different
                            LDAPQueryBuilder, which allows for more customization than only the  query.

                            <entry>
                            The query that is executed when searching for a user by full name. 
                            For example: (&amp; (objectClass=inetOrgPerson) (|({0}=*{1}*)({2}=*{3}*)) )
                            Here, all the objects in LDAP with the class 'inetOrgPerson'
                            and who have the matching first name and last name values will be returned.
                            Note that {0} injects the firstNameAttribute (as defined above), {1} and {3} the search text
                            and {2} the lastNameAttribute. If setting the query alone is insufficient for your specific
                            LDAP setup, you can alternatively plug in a different
                            LDAPQueryBuilder, which allows for more customization than only the  query.

                            <entry>The query that is executed when searching for the groups of a specific user.
                            For example: (&amp;(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(uniqueMember={0}))
                            Here, all the objects in LDAP with the class 'groupOfUniqueNames'
                            and where the provided DN (matching a DN for a user) is a 'uniqueMember' are returned.

                            The LDAPQueryBuilder instance is used when the LDAPUserManager or
                            LDAPGroupManage} does an actual query against the LDAP system.
                            The default implementation uses the properties as set on this instance
                            such as queryGroupsForUser and queryUserById</entry>

                            <entry> Allows to set the size of the group cache.
                            This is an LRU cache that caches groups for users and thus
                            avoids hitting the LDAP system each time the groups of
                            a user needs to be known.
                            
                            The cache will not be instantiated if the value is less then zero.
                            By default set to -1, so no caching is done.

                            <entry>Sets the expiration time of the group cache in milliseconds.
                            When groups for a specific user are fetched, and if the group cache exists,
                            the groups will be stored in this cache for the time set in this property.
                            ie. when the groups were fetched at 00:00 and the expiration time is 30 mins,
                            any fetch of the groups for that user after 00:30 will not come from the cache, but do
                            a fetch again from the LDAP system. Likewise, everything group fetch for that user done
                            between 00:00 - 00:30 will come from the cache.</entry>

            Note when using Active Directory: people in the Activiti forum have reported that for Activiti Directory, the 'InitialDirContext' needs to be set
            to Context.REFERRAL. This can be passed through the customConnectionParameters map as described above.

                        Obviously replacing the values with your own values. The value that needs to be used is the id of the group (configurable
                        through <literal>groupIdAttribute</literal>). The config above will make all members of the 'admin' group an Administrator user
                        in Activiti Explorer and similar for the user group. Any group not matching these values is seen as an 'assignment' group, 
                        ie where tasks can become assigned to.
