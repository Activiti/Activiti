  <title>Experimental features</title>
  <para>Sections marked with <emphasis role="bold">[EXPERIMENTAL]</emphasis> should 
  not be considered stable.
  </para>
  <para>All classes that have <literal>.impl.</literal> in the package name are internal implementation classes 
  and can not be considered stable.  However, if the user guide mentions those classes as configuration
  values, they are supported and can be considered stable. 
  </para>
</section>

<section id="internal">
  <title>Internal implementation classes</title>
  <para>In the jar file, all classes in packages that have <literal>.impl.</literal> (e.g. <literal>org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.delegate</literal>)
  in them are implementation classes and should be considered internal. No stability guarantees are given on classes or interfaces 
  that are in implementation classes.
