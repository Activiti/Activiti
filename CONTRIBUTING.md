Unit tests
--------------------
Activiti uses now [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-features-highlight.html) 
as alternative to default JUnit assertions. This makes your tests more readable and provides clearer failure messages. 
Please, make sure that you are using `AssertJ` assertions for every new test.
