</li>
</ul>
        

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.19.0</h3>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>We introduced a new service DynamicBpmnService that allows you to change a defined set of properties of a process definition without needing to redeploy <a href="http://bpmn20inaction.blogspot.com/2015/10/adding-dynamic-behaviour-to-activiti.html">http://bpmn20inaction.blogspot.com/2015/10/adding-dynamic-behaviour-to-activiti.html</a></li>
    <li>Improved support for the terminate end event. According to the BPMN spec a terminate end event should only terminate the current scope. 
    So in case of a multi instance sub process, a terminate end event inside that multi instance sub process should only kill a single instance and the rest
    of the instances (of the multi instance) will continue. And in case a call activity kicks off a sub process, a terminate end event in the sub process 
    will only kill the sub process instance, and the parent process will continue. We've added a new attribute on the terminate end event (activiti:terminateAll) 
    that allows you to terminate all parent scopes if the value is set to true. By default only the current scope is killed.</li>
    <li>ACT-4072 was fixed, a repeating timer (time cycle) now works according to the defined duration values</li>
    <li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.18.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>We introduced bulk inserts. For more information you can read more about it in this blog post <a href="http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2015/07/20/the-activiti-performance-showdown-2015/">http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2015/07/20/the-activiti-performance-showdown-2015/</a></li>
    <li>We enhanced the OR query support, it's now possible to use multiple OR parts in one query</li>
    <li>Improvements to the async executor we introduced in Activiti 5.17.0. There were some cases that could result in deadlock exceptions and that's resolved in this version.</li>
    <li>Improvements to the Activiti Modeler with terminate end events, cancel event and transaction support, and more intermediate catch and throw event support. 
    Also, improvements to interrupting and non-interrupting solid and dashed line for boundary events.</li>
    <li>Upgraded Spring dependency version to 4.1. Activiti is still working with Spring 4.0.x and 3.x as well</li>
    <li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<ul>
	<li>There's a known issue with Chrome and the Activiti Explorer / Vaadin 6. You can get a blank screen in the details part of the Explorer.
	This is a known issue for Vaadin 6 and Chrome 43 and 44. There are bug fixes under way with Chrome 45, so that might fix it. Other browsers like Firefox work fine.</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>Backwards incompatible changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-2186">https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-2186</a> : When variables are removed, the historic variable entry is also removed. In earlier versions, the value of the historic variable was set to <i>null</i>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-4036">https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-4036</a> : when using an execution listener for the <i>start</i> event, in combination with multi instance, the behavior is changed. In 5.18, there will be one extra invocation of the execution listener (when entering the multi instance, without the loopCounter variable being said). For more information, check the section <i>Multi instance and execution listeners</i> in the user guide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.17.0</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>We introduced a fully tested and brand new Async executor, which supersedes the old Job executor.
        The new Async executor uses less database queries to execute asynchronous jobs and is more performant in general.
        By default the Activiti Engine still uses the old Job executor, so you have to explicitly choose for the new Async executor by setting the asyncExecutorEnabled property in the process engine configuration.
        For more details you can look at the advanced section of the user guide.</li>
    <li>The Activiti Modeler is fully revised and is implemented using Angular JS. This is donated from the Alfresco Activiti BPMN editor that's part of the <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/products/activiti">Alfresco Activiti Enterprise offering</a>. The new Angular JS Activiti Modeler is LGPL licensed.
        Note that some dialogs are not yet ported to the new Activiti Modeler, but you'll also find quite a bit of new functionality, including Mule and Camel tasks and being able to define a sequence flow order for an exclusive gateway. Any help with adding new features is really appreciated.</li>
    <li>The user guide has been revamped with a rewrite to AsciiDoc</li>
    <li>It's now possible to start a process instance a skip tasks based on a skipExpression. This is very handy when you are migrating process instances to the Activiti Engine (thanks to Robert Hafner for the pull request).
    <li>We added a new module named activiti-jmx to the Activiti project, which enables JMX for the Activiti Engine. Read <a href="http://tech.blog.saeidmirzaei.com/?p=251">Saeids blog</a> for more details (thanks Saeid).
    <li>Variable fetching has been optimized for process instances and executions in general.</li>
    <li>The database upgrade scripts use a different minor version than the JAR version. With the 5.17.0 release, the database version is 5.17.0.2. This versioning enables us to release snapshots and still be able to upgrade from a snapshot release to a stable release.
        For a 5.17.1 release the database version will be 5.17.1.x where x can be any number. So only the last minor version number can differ from the Activiti Engine release version.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Specific notes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Note that the version number is 5.17.0 instead of 5.17. Make sure you use version 5.17.0 for your Maven dependency.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.16.4</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>

    <li>Restlet has been replaced with Spring MVC for the REST API</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementation changes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-2071">https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-2071</a>:
        A deployment must always contain at least one executable (property 'isExecutable' on the process element) process definition
        to be deployable. However, a deployment can now contain process definitions that are not executable.
        Before, any non-executable process definition would result in a validation error.
        Now, these are warnings which do not prevent the deployment.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Bug fix for database constraint issue, introduced in 5.16</li>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.14</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Version 5.14 is focused on bug fixes and small improvements.</li>
    <li>Improved process and task query support</li>
    <li>Add OSGi bundle headers to all Activiti module JARs</li>
    <li>Thanks to the community for the large number of pull requests, especially Martin Grofcik, Mike Dias and Saeid Mirzaei</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important Note for MSSQL and DB2 users</h4>

<p>
    Activiti 5.13 and 5.14 contain changes to the default indexes that are created when using
    MSSQL or DB2 as database. These indexes <b>are not created automatically when upgrading Activiti</b>,
    as they may conflict with custom indexes or impact the database load. The purpose if the indexes
    is to avoid deadlock exceptions when using Activiti under high load.
</p>

<p>
    As such, please review carefully following commits and apply to your database (where applicable):

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.12.1</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fix for ACT-1591, with referential constraint error (<a href="https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-1591">JIRA link</a>)</li>
    <li>Resolved javascript JDK 7 issue (<a href="http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2013/03/25/bug-on-jdk-1-7-0_17-when-using-scripttask-in-activiti/">link to blog post</a>)</li>
    <li>Small Explorer and Modeler bug fixes</li>
    <li>Other small fixes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important upgrade notes when using script tasks and auto storage of variables</h4>

<p>
    Due to recent changes to the JDK (removing Serializable from sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.Undefined), the auto storing of variables is not possible anymore
    with the built-in Javascript scripting engine. See <a href="http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2013/03/25/bug-on-jdk-1-7-0_17-when-using-scripttask-in-activiti/">this link</a>
    for more information. Each script variable that needs to be stored as process variable needs to be explicitly
    stored by calling <i>execution.setVariable("variableName", variableValue)</i>.
</p>

<p>
    For backwards compatibility reasons, the old behavior can still be used by setting the <i>autoStoreVariables</i> property
    on a <i>scriptTask</i> to true. As written in the linked article from above, this might not work when using a recent JDK version
    and the built-in Javascript scripting engine.
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.12</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Added new javascript-based diagram viewer to Explorer (thanks to Dmitry Farafonov)</li>
    <li>Unified the BPMN parser and model for the Engine, Modeler and Designer</li>
    <li>Added Activiti Kickstart to the Explorer to quickly create processes without deep BPMN knowledge</li>
    <li>Simplified and extended the Activiti Camel module (thanks to Ryan Johnston)</li>
    <li>Added first stage of reporting functionality to the Explorer via "reporting processes"</li>
    <li>Added auto-layout module for Kickstart and BPMN import in Modeler (TBD) and Designer</li>
    <li>Added script task and execution listeners</li>
    <li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important upgrade note</h4>

<p>
    The internal <i>org.activiti.engine.impl.bpmn.parser.BpmnParseListener</i> interface and related classes have been removed.
</p>

<p>
    Yes, we know many people relied on its capabilities, although it was a class in an internal package. But do not worry:
    we have introduced a replacement in the <b>api package</b> that offers similar (and even more powerful) functionality.
    The code is not backwards compatible, but the required changes should be minimal (eg the XML element is replaced by a
    Java pojo representation of the element). Read more about it in the new 'Advanced' chapter of the userguide.

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.11</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Added Activiti Modeler to the Activiti Explorer web application</li>
    <li>Removed buggy demo script and replaced with simpler distribution</li>
    <li>Support for doing queries that are not out-of-the-box possible with the query api (called 'native queries')</li>
    <li>Enhanced ability to query for history variable values</li>
    <li>Improved functionality to suspend and activate process definitions and instances</li>
    <li>Improved Activiti QA and added DB2 and MSSQL servers</li>
    <li>Added support for using a service call in aJava delegates (see <a href="http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2012/10/25/call-a-service-in-a-service-tas/">here</a> for more details)</li>
    <li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important upgrade note</h4>
<p>In 5.11 we introduce a new history table for process variables. There is an optional migration database script
    that you can run to generate historic variables for existing process instances.  This is optional because
    the engine will just create those records upon update of the variable if they don't exist.
</p>
<p>The files can be found in the database directory of the Activiti distribution
    <code>org/activiti/db/upgrade/optional</code>.
</p>

<h4>API Change</h4>
<p>The functionality of the repositoryService.suspendProcessDefinitionByXXX has been slightly altered.
    Previously, calling this method would stop the execution of jobs related to this process definition.
    Now, calling this method will <b>not</b> do this, but rather make sure a process instance
    cannot be created from this process definition. We've added a new method with an additional
    parameter 'suspendProcessInstances' which can be used to get the same behavior: when set to 'true',
    all the associated process instances will be suspended. This will avoid process instance continuation,
    including the execution of jobs related to the process instance.</p>

<h4>Bug fixes and various smaller improvements</h4>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.7</h3>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A new Activiti Explorer application completely rewritten in Vaadin</li>
    <li>The REST services have been rewritten to Restlet</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important</h4>

<p>
    A couple of add-on applications have spun off from the Activiti download and
    started life on their own.  Activiti Modeler continues as a Google code project
    called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/signavio-core-components/">Signavio Core Components</a>.
    Activiti Cycle now lives on as <a href="http://fox.camunda.com/doc/#cycle">Camunda Fox</a>.
    An evolved version of Activiti KickStart will become part of a new Alfresco cloud case management
    solution.
</p>

<p>
    Activiti Explorer has acquired Activiti Probe for an undisclosed amount :-)  The resulting
    Activiti Explorer has been restyled and includes more dynamic task management features.
</p>

<p>
    The REST services were rewritten with the Restlet framework with backwards compatibility, so the REST interfaces haven't changed.
    The previous versions of Activiti included a REST services web application that used the Spring Surf and Webscripts framework.
    To implement a new or revised REST service you had to learn these frameworks. With moving to Restlet implementing new or revised REST services has become really simple.
</p>

<p>
    The demo setup has been limited to H2 database only, as many people struggled with getting
    the demo setup to run on their databases. The demo setup is a quick way to get familiar
    with Activiti and its tools, but it is by no means meant for production purposes.
    A section <i>'Changing the database'</i> has been added to the userguide and is intended for advanced users
    who want to run the Activiti tools on their servers and databases.

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.6</h3>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Added direct <a href="http://bpmn20inaction.blogspot.com/2011/05/supersize-activiti-with-mule-esb-and.html">Mule and Camel integration</a></li>
    <li>Easier way to retrieve businessKey from task listeners</li>
    <li>Improved support for Alfresco processes</li>
    <li>Added support for delegateExpressions in tasklistener</li>
    <li>Added support for BPMN multi instance in the eclipse designer</li>
    <li>Extended length of all user defined text columns to 4000</li>
</ul>

<h4>Known upgrade limitation</h4>
<p>In the DB schema creation scripts, we've enlarged the max size of certain varchar columns from 255 to 4000.
    See <a href="https://activiti.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-236">ACT-236</a>.  These schema updates are not part of the
    automatic upgrade procedure.
</p>

<p>Max length of following columns has been set to 4000:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ACT_RU_JOB.EXCEPTION_MSG_</li>
    <li>ACT_RU_JOB.HANDLER_CFG_</li>
    <li>ACT_RE_PROCDEF.RESOURCE_NAME_</li>
    <li>ACT_RE_PROCDEF.DGRM_RESOURCE_NAME_</li>
    <li>ACT_RU_TASK.DESCRIPTION_</li>
    <li>ACT_RU_VARIABLE.TEXT_</li>
    <li>ACT_RU_VARIABLE.TEXT2_</li>
    <li>ACT_HI_TASKINST.DESCRIPTION_</li>
    <li>ACT_HI_TASKINST.DELETE_REASON_</li>

    <li>ACT_HI_COMMENT.MESSAGE_</li>
    <li>ACT_HI_ATTACHMENT.DESCRIPTION_</li>
    <li>ACT_HI_ATTACHMENT.URL_</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to perform these changes, you can do that manually.  Check your database capabilities for the
    easiest way on changing the type of columns from varchar(255) to varchar(4000).  As a fall back,
    for each table affected, you can:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>create a new temporary table</li>
    <li>copy the contents from the original to the temporary table</li>
    <li>delete the original table</li>
    <li>recreate the original table using the new create script with the proper lengths</li>
    <li>copy the contents from the temporary table back to the new original table</li>
    <li>drop the temporary table</li>
</ol>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.4</h3>

<h4>Compatibility note</h4>
<p>After releasing 5.3, we discovered that
    execution listeners and task listeners and expressions were still in non-public api. Those classes were in subpackages
    of <code>org.activiti.engine.impl...</code>,  which has <code>impl</code> in it).
    <code>org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.delegate.ExecutionListener</code>,
    <code>org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.delegate.TaskListener</code> and
    <code>org.activiti.engine.impl.pvm.el.Expression</code>
    have been deprecated. From now on, you should use <code>org.activiti.engine.delegate.ExecutionListener</code>,
    <code>org.activiti.engine.delegate.TaskListener</code> and <code>org.activiti.engine.delegate.Expression</code>.
    In the new publicly available API, access to
    <code>ExecutionListenerExecution.getEventSource()</code> has been removed.  Apart from the deprecation
    compiler warning, the existing code should run fine.  But consider switching to the new public
    API interfaces (without .impl. in the package name).
</p>

<h3>Release Notes - Activiti - Version 5.1</h3>

<h4>Warning</h4>
<p>The automatic upgrade does not have enough coverage to have full confidence.
    For more info, see <a href="docs/userguide/index.html#databaseUpgrade">the user guide, section Database upgrade</a>.
</p>

<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In attribute &lt;serviceTask delegateExpression="..."&gt; previously always performed a leave after
        calling the delegate that was obtained by evaluating the expression.  Which means that it's always an automatic
        activity.  Now the leave is only performed only when the delegate object implements JavaDelegate.  In case the
        delegate object implements ActivityBehavior the leave will not be called.  In that case, the ActivityBehavior is
        responsible for calling leave if it wants to be an automatic activity.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Added Activiti KickStart making the creation of new BPMN process models as easy as 1, 2, 3</li>
